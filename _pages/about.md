I am PhD student at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health in the Health Economics & Policy track. My research interests include access to mental health treatments for people with mental illnesses and healthcare access for undocumented immigrants. Prior to starting my PhD, I was a Research Fellow at the Stanford Law School before working as an economic consultant in Boston, MA.
